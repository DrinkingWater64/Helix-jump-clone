# Helix jump clone
 a helix jump clone made using unity.
 The basic mechanism are implemented and not worked on the ui and stuff.
 
 Challenge faced:
    Took a lot of time to figure out that the ball was hitting two platform at once and creating a huge jump. 
    Fixed it using coroutine to create a death timer which makes my ball to wait for few seconds before jumping againg.
